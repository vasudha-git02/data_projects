## âœ… Key Steps

- Used Glob to load multiple files
- Cleaned percentage (`%`) and currency (`$`) signs from multiple columns
- Split composite columns like `GenderPop` into `Men` and `Women`
- Handled missing values using logical derivations
- Verified and removed duplicates and null values
- Created visualizations to understand trends in income and demographic attributes

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

- **Racial Distribution** (scatter plot)
- **Top 10 States by Income** (bar chart)
- **Racial Distribution by State** (pie chart)

## ðŸ§  Next Steps (Future Work)

- Build an ETL pipeline to automate data collection and cleaning
- Store raw and processed data in Amazon S3
- Use AWS Glue for transformation and load into Amazon Redshift
- Build a dashboard using Power BI or Streamlit
